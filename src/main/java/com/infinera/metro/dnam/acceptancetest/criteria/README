From Continuous Delivery chapter 8:
    "With a well-designed application driver layer, it becomes possible to
     completely dispense with the acceptance criteria layer and express the
     acceptance criteria in the implementation of the test."

I will try to go with this approach to begin with, and skip acceptance criteria layer
(and also Cucumber and the likes).
